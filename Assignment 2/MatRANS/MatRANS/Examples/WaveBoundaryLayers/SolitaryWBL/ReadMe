This case tests the transitional turbulence model, as implemented in Williams and Fuhrman (2016).  This case compares the resulting bed shear stress from a simulated solitary wave boundary layer against experimental measurements of Sumer et al. (2010), as well as against the laminar theory of Liu et al. (2007).  The Compare.m script additionally animates the temporal evolution of the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles, where there is clearly a transition to turbulence that occurs during the transient flow.

Note:
In 2018 a bug was found in the transitional model code - the "alpha_star" coefficient was missing in the omega production term. This explains why the Williams and Fuhrman (2016) and Kirca et al. (2016) papers required using the transitional coefficient R_k=3 rather than R_k=6.  This bug is now fixed and this example utilizes the corrected model. Note that this only affects simulations with the transitional model i.e. with turb=2.
