This case considers combined wave-plus-current flow.  It is designed
to repeat the conditions considered in Example 3.1 of Fredsoe and
Deigaard (1992, p. 61).  First, a pure current, driven by a constant
pressure gradient, is allowed to develop over some time.  The results 
at the end of the pure-current simulation are then loaded as initial
 conditions for a sub-sequent combined wave-plus-current simulation.
  In the comparison, the development of the period-averaged current 
velocity is animated through time, with the end results compared 
against the analytical expressions (both outside and inside the wave
boundary layer) for wave-plus-current flow provided by Fredsoe and
Deigaard (1992).  The results clearly demonstrate e.g. the effect of 
the wave-induced roughness on the current.  The expected logarithmic 
profile for the pure current conditions is also plotted, for 
comparison.
